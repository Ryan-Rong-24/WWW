              <p>ASES Launchpad is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">two-day</span> event for high school students across the country to explore the fundamentals of entrepreneurship. This year, our in-person program explores the theme of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Social Good in San Francisco</span>. In teams, you will create socially impactful ideas to tackle various issues in San Francisco—such as food security, transportation, and housing—and we’ll provide you with the skills to turn that idea into a viable prototype and pitch. We have an itinerary full of exciting speakers, interactive workshops, and college panels. The event culminates in a final pitch competition, where teams have the opportunity to present their solutions and receive personalized feedback from real Stanford student founders. 
              </p>
              <p>We at ASES believe that any individual can make a positive impact through entrepreneurship. Launchpad is <span style="font-weight: bold;">completely free</span> for participants and no prior experience is required — in fact, we especially encourage those without any entrepreneurship experience and those historically underrepresented in tech to apply!</p>

          <div class="answer">
            We welcome anyone to apply to Launchpad, regardless of your experience in entrepreneurship - in fact, we especially encourage those without any entrepreneurship experience and those from underrepresented
            backgrounds to apply. The only requirement is that you are a current high school student and are able to be present during the entire duration of Launchpad.
